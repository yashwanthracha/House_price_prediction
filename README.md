House price prediction projects use machine learning algorithms to analyze data and predict future prices. 
Machine learning models use historical data and features such as:
1.Avg Area Income
2.Avg Area House Age
3.Avg Area Number of Rooms
4.Avg Area Number of Bedrooms
5.Area Population	
6.price
7.Address

Linear regression is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to predict house prices.
The goal of a house price prediction project is to develop a tool that uses machine learning to predict house prices.
The tool will take input from the user, such as the location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant features of the house.

Here are some steps for a house price prediction project:
1.Gather and preprocess relevant data
2.Build and fine-tune the model
3.Evaluate the model's performance
